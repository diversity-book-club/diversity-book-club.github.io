    <h1>How the Diversity Book Club works</h1>

    <p>
        Every two weeks a new link will be published to an article/video/etc that will take roughly 5 to 15 minutes to consume.
        You will then be able discussed what you took away from this in a communication channel that best fits each given community, ie. chat, mailinglist, forum, video chat. Note that moderators should always be able to participate to help answer questions and collect interesting points of views to be shared with other communities.

    <p>
        After two weeks the moderators will collaborate on writing a summary blog post capturing the essence of the discussions in all of the communities.
