    <h1>Who is behind the diversity book club initiative?</h1>

    <p>
        The initiative is still in its infancy and wil hopefully grow.
        The idea originated in the <a href="https://symfony.com">Symfony</a> diversity initiative.
        Currently its mainly <a href="mailto:diversity-book-club@pooteeweet.org">Lukas Kahwe Smith</a> that is moving the idea forward.
